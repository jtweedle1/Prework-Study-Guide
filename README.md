# First Project: Prework Study Guide

## Description

My motivation for this project was to take a metaphorical leap of faith into the world of coding. Being able to program and understand the foundations of web development has always been one of my goals in life so it feels amazing being able to manifest that as a reality.

I built this project to learn and understand Git (version control), HTML (the backbone), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (logic and interactivity). It also allows me to store some of the key notes that were learned from each lesson, so it was practical and functional! It solves the problem of not having an organized space to story important notes from the Prework for Northwestern's coding bootcamp.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

1. Make sure that you have the following programs installed: web browser, VS Code, Git Bash or Mac equivalent.
2. Download all of the files and make sure they are stored in a bootcamp directory under your respective user directory.
3. Make sure to create your own repository on GitHub (if necessary), and follow online instructions to connect your online repository to your local files.
4. Feel free to make any necessary changes! Mix it up!

## Usage

This website diplays notes from each section that we learned about during the course of the Prework. It includes information on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the console in DevTools, JavaScript will be enabled and you can see some of the fun things we did with JavsScript, such as generating a suggested study topic.

## Credits

This project was completed by me, Jazmin. I used the instructions that came along with the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp Prework Course.
